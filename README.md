# Welcome ü§úüèæü§õüèæ


### A little introduction about me
I have been working with software development for over 6 months, and I have over 2 years of academic experience in it.
I consider myself a junior level in software development, and this is my level of knowledge (some higher) in technologies such as: Angular, HTML, CSS, Typescript, Kotlin, ColdFusion, Java, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git and Gitlab.

I have a degree in System Analysis and Development by FIAP (Faculdade de Inform√°tica e Administra√ß√£o Paulista).

### About my repositories

I tried to make public only the repositories that I made entirely. The Projects that I carried out in courses are private. But I can share if you want to.

### Studies

I'm currently learning Java and its framework: Spring. Despite I continue to learn others technologies, such as Angular and its ecosystem.
I confess that lately I fell in love with Spring by the way things can be done with it. Well, soon enough more projects will appear here.

### Projects - or not

You can see the project that I made in React Native in the repo app-can-donate.

You can you se a full CRUD made in React and NodeJS by cloning the repo crud-react and crud-emerson-nodejs.

You can see the repo Evictory-personal-website to inspire you.

I would like to explain more about these projects, but if I were to do it again TODAY, I would do it differently.


**Well, as I always say, enjoy coding!**
